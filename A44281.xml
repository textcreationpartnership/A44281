         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How doe we receive the communion after the example of Chriſt (which we juſtly urge for ſitting at the Communion,) if after the adminiſtration thereof we doe not ſing an Hymne or Pſalme? When are we Chriſtian-like merry, if not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivall of mercies from the hand of God? And how are we merry according to the preſcript, of Scriptures, Jam. 5. if we ſing not? Saints glory in tribulation oft-times, Rom. 5.2. ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing Pſalmes in the priſon, yea in the ſtocks. What kind of Chriſtians then are we, that will not ſing at all? Seaſon no duties with ſinging? Whereas the Churches in the primitive times, in the ten perſecutions, ſugared and ſweetned their meetings and duties with ſinging of Pſalmes afore they parted, as we heard before. The truth is, devout ſinging of Pſalmes is a ſavourie ſauce to reliſh every condition and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that is an iterated ordinance. For Baptiſme after once adminiſtration, is never to be repeated. Before Sermon the Churches ſing, to quicken their hearts to prayer. After the communion they ſing, to raiſe them up in praiſe. Yea I may ſay, this ſpirituall ſauce is meat it ſelfe. In ſinging we pray, we praiſe, we confeſſe, we petition, we exhort, we meditate, we beleeve, we joy, we mourn.

It is moſt certain alſo, upon exceeding good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that ſinging of Pſalmes hath mightily humbled the ſoule even to teares. The Pſalme after a Sermon ſometimes hath done that which the Sermon alone could not doe. The Sermon as it were turned the wind into a warme quarter to begin to thaw the ſoule; and then the Pſalm hath been as the breaking out of the Sun-beames, to make the heart run with melting. As for petitions, confeſſions of ſinnes, confeſſion of confidence in God, they are the common language of Pſalms. See the whole Book of Pſalmes.</p>

God hath given <hi>hearing</hi> to hear him in his Word, as well as men in the world; <hi>Speech</hi> to pray to him as well as to ſpeak to men: <hi>Sight</hi> to conſider of his works, as well a man to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own: And therefore he hath given the naturall gift of <hi>Singing</hi> (a Muſick that excels all inſtrumentall) to the end to praiſe and worſhip him, every man quickning himſelf and others by ſymphonie, and ſinging concent together. Singing is the onely active vocall propheſying that is allowed to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. In which dutie ſhe is to keep

Singing is a great preparation to propheſying, both extraordinarie and ordinarie. The ſtorie of <hi>Eliſha</hi> is famous, in whom the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie ſpirit of propheſying was ſtirred up by Muſick, and his own troubled ſpirit of grief and unfitneſſe for propheſie was allayd and ſweetned. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>And Eliſha ſaid to the King of Iſrael, What have I to do with thee? &amp;c. And Eliſha ſaid, &amp;c. ſurely were it not that I regard the preſence of Jehoſbaphat the King of Judah, I would not look towards thee, nor ſee thee. But now bring me a Minſtrel. And it came to paſſe when the Minſtrel played, that the hand of the Lord</hi> (that is, the ſpirit of propheſie) <hi>came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi> And he ſaid, Thus ſaith the Lord, &amp;c. and ſo went on propheſying to the three Kings there met. If this Muſick being onely inſtrumentall, made by a private perſon, and ſo onely civill, did thus move the Prophet; how much more will vocall Church Muſick in ſinging Pſalms, inſtituted by God, incite graces?<note place="margin">Cujus operâ, (ideſt fidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinis) pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus ipſius (ideſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetae) ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiâ impii regis Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum ſeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.

Many that are not yet brought ſo home to Religion as they ſhould, may be brought in to ſome love with religious duties for the ſake of that ſweet one ſingings of Pſalms. The Indians are drawn to the Churches in New-England, by delighting in their ſinging day, that is, their ſinging on the Lords day.

                  <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, <q>That muſicall harmonic if but by voice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of high and lowe ſounds is of that force, and hath ſuch pleaſing effects in that very part of man which is moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that ſome have been thereby induced to think that the ſoul it ſelf by nature is, or hath in it harmony. A thing which delighteth all ages, and beſeemeth all ſtates. A thing as ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in grief, as in joy; as decent being added to actions of greateſt weight, and ſolemnitie, as being uſed when men moſt ſequeſter themſelves from action. The reaſon hereof is an admirable facilitie which Muſick hath to expreſſe, and repreſent to the mind more inwardly then any other ſenſible mean, the very ſtanding, riſing and falling, the ſteps and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections every way, the turns, and varieties of all paſſions whereunto the mind is ſubject; yea ſo to imitate them, that whether it reſemble unto us the ſame ſtate, wherein our minds already are, or a clean contrary we are not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly confirmed by the one, then changed and led away by the other. In harmonie the very image, and character even of vertues and vice is perceived, the mind delighted with their reſemblances, and brought by having them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten iterated into a love of the things themſelves. Yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we lay altogether aſide the conſideration of dittie or matter, the verie harmonie of ſounds being framed in due ſort, and carried from the eare to the ſpirituall faculties of our ſouls, is by a native puiſſance and efficacie greatly avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bring to a perfect temper whatſoever is there trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beld; a part as well to quicken the ſpirits, as to allay that which is too eager; ſoveraigne againſt melancholie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, forcible to draw forth tears of devotion, if the mind be ſuch as can yeeld them. Able both to move and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all affections. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> therefore having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular skill not in Poetrie alone, but in Muſick alſo, judged them both to be things moſt neceſſarie for the houſe of God; left behind him to that purpoſe a number of Divinitie endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Poems, for the raiſing mens hearts, and the ſweetning of their affections towards God. In which conſiderations the Church of Chriſt doth retain it to this day.</q> Thus far <hi>Hooker.</hi>

The glorie of God is held forth more illuſtrious, becauſe by this means the praiſes of God contained in Pſalms, and Hymnes are celebrated more magnificently and gloriouſly, with greater attention, and admiration of the auditorie, then if they were recited with a lower voice without ſinging. Which was the cauſe why the Levites in ſetting forth the great benefits of God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did do it with ſweet harmonie. So before the building of the Temple, when they carried the Ark, they ſang with a ſhrill voice, <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be ſcattered.</hi> And when they returned conquerours they alſo ſung, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the benefits of God might be better underſtood, more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively heard, and more princelike admired.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49761:10"/>time. Who then ſhalbe able upon a ſudden to ſpeak matter and forme that is meeter, fit for ſinging. For if men will ſing, though alone, any tune, and not yell out a confuſed noiſe, they muſt meaſure out their words to a certain length. And then who can ſtudy matter and meeter all in the ſame inſtant, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout too? We never read in the Scripture of any ſuch, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary, <hi>David</hi> penned his Pſalmes, <hi>Moſes</hi> penned his Song, and both with exactneſſe and variety of meeter, which argue not ſudden rapſodicall ſinging. 2. We ſay that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians can ſing together, becauſe their meditations will differ, if not the meeter too, and ſo make confuſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Chriſtians deliberate compoſing the matter of Pſalms to be ſung in common, we have no rule in the Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that. Generally thoſe that penned the matter of Pſalms, were extraordinary men, as <hi>Moſes, David, Iſaiab, Jeremiah, Haba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk, &amp;c.</hi> 2. We read of a gift of praying and preaching, &amp;c. But we read not of a particular gift given by Chriſt in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to one above another, to compoſe the matter or ditties of Pſalms. If not, then 3. there will be a doubt whoſe Pſalms ſhall be ſung, whether thoſe compoſed by this brother, or that brother. 3. We preferre mans compoſall before Gods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in preaching, the Scriptures is the text. In baptizing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the communion, the Scripture is the form. For pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lords prayer is the plat-forme. And ſo by the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes are the dittie for ſinging. In all to keep to the plat-formes of Scripture. 4. Men are but men. If in the matter or dittie: (for I do not now ſpeake of meeter) there ſhould be any unfoundneſſe of doctrine, by cuſtome and the muſick, the people would fall in love with it, and as <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith very well, there would be no removing it.</p>
               <p>If all Churches ſhould have their ſeveral meeters for ſinging, it would not ſo tend to the union of Churches, and anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of emulations. But if all Chriſtians ſhould be left to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſeverall ſpirituall ſongs upon all varieties of occaſions, the ſtrong would be forced to ſpend much time in metricall compoſalls, and yet not have one in a readineſſe ſutable to a new emergent occaſion, when the cauſe and the cheerful mind call for it; and the weak ſhall never ſing, becauſe they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none at all.</p>
               <p>For a generall cloſe to all that is objected of ſinging with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49761:11"/>the ſpirit, and worſhipping in ſpirit, Joh. 4. We ſay, That we may ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and yet ſing with the ſpirit. As prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the text of the Goſpel is a miniſtery of the Spirit, 2. Cor. 3. And ſo in uſing Scripture forms of baptizing and holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Spirit doth come in with it; the more we ſay, or pray, or ſing the words of the Spirit, the more do we thoſe according to the mind of the Spirit. All what the Spirit ſuggeſts, is what it hath already written, and for us to uſe, as Rom. 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever was written afore time, was for our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Objection from the <hi>matter,</hi> is this. <hi>Is not</hi> (ſay the reaſons againſt ſinging) <hi>this a confuſed praiſing God, when we ſhall offer to him the exhortations of praiſe? This is giving to God his exhortation again, and leaving the duty undone. Is not this ſinfull to anſwer God in his own words? God commands his people to praiſe him: Now for us to take thoſe words God ſpeakes to us, and ſpeak them to God again, and thereby think we have done the duty, when indeed we leave the duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. This is ſinfull.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why may we not as well ſing to God what God ſayes to us, as well as pray that in prayer which God ſaith to us. <hi>David</hi> did both, Pſal. 27. <hi>Thou (Lord) ſaydſt, ſeek ye my face: My heart anſwered, Thy face Lord will I ſeek. David</hi> thinks he praiſeth God in ſong, by ſinging exhortations to praiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. See the firſt three verſes, and the laſt verſe. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>Praying is the beſt preparation to prayer; for then we ſet upon it in Gods ſtrength. But in meditation in our own ſtrength.</hi> So ſure ſinging exhortations to prayer, is an excellent preparation to ſing praiſes. And therefore <hi>David</hi> begins many of his Pſalms with exhortations to praiſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Anſw.</hi> This text is not meant of ſinging, and expreſſing what we find penned in the Word of God; But of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie inſpiration of the Spirit directing infallibly ſome few extraordinarie men, Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp;c. to pen the divine texts of Scriptures. Among which we find in other Scriptures that they penned ſome Pſalms and ſpirituall Songs; and ſang them themſelves, and there expreſly left them to the Churches to ſing. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Then ſang Moſes and the Children of Iſrael this Song.</hi> 2 Chron. 35.25. <hi>And Jeremiah lamented Joſiah, and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Iſrael, and behold they are written in the Lamentations.</hi> That is, in the Lamentations of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> penned with great varietie of meeter, as they that can but read Hebrew may ſee ſomewhat of it. And what is the meaning of the titles of the Pſalms (which are very Text) <hi>To the chief Muſitian:</hi> A Pſalme for <hi>Aſaph:</hi> A Pſalm for <hi>the ſons of Korah:</hi> A Pſalme for <hi>the Sabbath day:</hi> A Pſalm of <hi>degrees,</hi> of which there are many, which being excellent Pſalms were appointed to be ſung upon the ſtairs of the Temple in the beginning of their publick worſhip, and therefore ſome tranſlate, Pſalms <hi>of or for the ſtairs:</hi> I ſay, what is the meaning of all theſe titles of the Pſalms, if not left to the Churches to ſing?</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Anſw.</hi> If onely they muſt ſing that can ſpeak as they 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. laſt, then none muſt ſing. For propheſie is ceaſed, Apoſtles and extraordinarie men ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Anſw.</hi> Either the Churches muſt ſing theſe ſpirituall Pſalms and Songs compoſed in Scripture, or elſe ſome of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49761:12"/>own compoſing; or none. Not none, for it is an ordinance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the New Teſtament, as you have heard fully proved. If you ſing thoſe of your own compoſing; they are rather <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> by men, and <hi>impoſed</hi> by men, then the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. turned into Engliſh meeter. For in this we ſing for matter, and words as neer as may be, onely that which was invented and impoſed by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. ſort of Objections are from the <hi>tranſlation</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms into Engliſh meeter. This is an objection of a later ſtamp, then the <hi>Certain Reaſons.</hi> Some ſay that that tranſlation is full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Others ſpeak more groſly, that it hath many lyes in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſtand not here to juſtifie corrupt tranſlations. Nor on the other ſide may others talk of lyes in them, till they know what a lye is. Every ſpeaking an untruth by miſtake is not a lye; but a lye is, to ſpeak falſe and to know it, and yet vent it to the deceiving of the hearer. <hi>Mentiri eſt contra mentem ire,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auguſt.</hi> To lye is to ſpeak againſt ones conſcience. And <hi>Mendacem eſt falſa vocis ſignificatio, cum intentione fallendi. Aug. lib. de mendacium. To lye is to utter a falſhood with an intent to deceive.</hi> Dare any ſay, that Mr. <hi>Sternhold</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> &amp;c. that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms into Engliſh meeter, did wilfully miſtake, with an intent to deceive the Churches? Could they have done it, and other learned men never find them out in their ſtudie to deceive? As for corruptions in tranſlating, it ſhould ſeem their endeavour was to avoid them as much as they could, much more lying. For the Title of the ſinging Pſalms ſaith, that their tranſlation was conferred with the Hebrew. Durſt this title be ſo long printed, if for the generall it had not been true? Would the Churches, and Martyrs have ſo long uſed them, if in ſome good meaſure they had not been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done? What can there be done of men but ſtill it will appear as done by men; namely, imperfect. All tranſlations that ever were of the Bible in any language either of the Schools, as Greek and Latin, or of Nations, have many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; therefore ſhall we read none of them? The Churches knew there were many faults in the old Engliſh Tranſlation of our Bibles; did they therefore ill to read it till they had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? So hath the laſt and beſt Engliſh Tranſlations ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49761:13"/>miſtakes known to the Churches, therefore ſhall we not uſe it till we have a more exact? Do we ever look for perfection before the great <hi>reſtitution</hi> of all things? If any do tranſlate as neer as they can, and to the ſence, the holy Ghoſt accepts of it. The Greek Tranſlation is full of miſtakes; yet the Apoſtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that oft in the New Teſtament, where they tranſlate neer the ſence, though they miſſe in the phraſe. The very He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text it ſelf of the Old Teſtament, hath 800 diverſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. And ſometimes the holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament takes the one, ſometimes the other, ſometimes both. There is one miſtake, a groſſe one in all the Jews Bibles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16. where they put <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> kaaru for to <hi>pierce,</hi> which the holy Ghoſt corrects. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.35. And in the New Teſtament in Greek there are above a thouſand diverſe readings. Shall we therefore caſt away the whole Bible? Oft writing and printing will cauſe miſtakes in any books. God hath promiſed indeed to keep his word to an <hi>iota,</hi> to a tittle. But not in this or that particular <hi>individuall</hi> Copie, or Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> among all we ſhall find all the truth. So for men, God doth not reveal all minuts of truth to every man, but to all his Churches in generall, of Jews and Gentiles, that we may not be perfect the one without the other. Now then what will the Objectors do, if they will compoſe Pſalms of their own heads; muſt not they follow thoſe Tranſlations they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand? If ſo, that they do will not be perfect. I ſpeak not all this, as if againſt a better Tranſlation of the Pſalms into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Meeter, I do with the reformed Churches earneſtly deſire it. But I would not have an Ordinance laid aſide (with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the Brethren) becauſe we cannot have it in perfection.</p>

As for the holy Communion, it doth intimate us to be, and integrate and ſeal us into <hi>one bodie,</hi> (the bodie of Chriſt, is his Church) It doth ſuppoſe us to be one <hi>lump,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. one <hi>bread,</hi> 1 Corinth. 10. It is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to give one life to them that have ſome alreadie. And therefore in this Ordinance none but ſuppoſed Saints or beleevers may joyne with us. But for ſinging, the <hi>ſound</hi> is <hi>naturall,</hi> the <hi>tune artificiall,</hi> (in which is no ſpirituall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at all) and for the <hi>matter</hi> it is common as other places of Scripture to all. Laſtly for <hi>manner,</hi> if they ſing aright with faith and affection, they are meet for Communion therin. If not, they ſing not at all ſpiritually, and ſo we have no true fellowſhip with them; juſt as we may ſay as much of praying. Men may haply cavill againſt this anſwer; but let them reſt ſatisfied till they can ſhew us a word to exclude the mixed multitude from praying and ſinging as we have, from Communions. <hi>James</hi> writing to the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> ſcattered abroad, Jam. 1.1. bids them ſing Pſalms, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. I may ſay of this caſe here, as once was ſaid in humane ancient ſtories touching <hi>paricide,</hi> there was no Law anciently made againſt it, becauſe it was ſuppoſed never any child would be ſo <hi>unnaturall</hi> as to kill his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49761:14"/>parent. So no caſuiſt or controverſie moves this doubt of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms in a mixt congregation: therein all learned men are ſilent, as ſuppoſing none would be ſo unſpirituall as to queſtion it.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up all. You have heard what we can ſay for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the lawfulneſſe to ſing as we do in our Engliſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; wherein we concur with all reformed Churches. As that of <hi>Germany,</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> would call for the 46 Pſalm in his troubles; And <hi>Zamchie</hi> would ſay,<note place="margin">Zanch. <hi>on Epheſ. 5.</hi> de Muſic. in Eccleſ.</note> 
                  <hi>By any means ſing the Pſalms and Hymnes of the Scriptures, for the bringing in of others will be of dangerous conſequence.</hi> Of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>Buchanan</hi> was ſo taken with it, that he moſt elegantly turned the Pſalms into Latin Meeter. Of the Greek Churches, of the <hi>French,</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> of <hi>New-England;</hi> all which have for that purpoſe tranſlated <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Pſalms into Meeter in their own tongues. Even as at this day (as I am aſſured from them that have been eare witneſſes) the Jews in their Synagogues ſing the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> in their own Hebrew tongue. So that beſides all that hath been ſaid, we have the cuſtone of all the reformed Churches of God; and this is not to be deſpiſed<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.16.</note>, but rather they that yet will not be ſatisfied are to be put by with that of the Apoſtle in another caſe, <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious,</hi> (as to lay aſide ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms) <hi>we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> In the ſame 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.</p>

            <head>A Diſcourſe of our worthy Brethren of <hi>New-England,</hi> declaring their grave Judgement touching not onely the lawfulneſſe, but alſo the neceſſity of the heavenly Ordinance of ſinging Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Meeter in the Churches of God. Which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe coming to the hand of the Author, after he had finiſhed his weak Tract, he thought good to annex for ſtrengthening his, and ſetling the doubting Chriſtian.</head>
            <p>THe ſinging of Pſalms, though it breath forth nothing but holy harmony, and melodie: yet ſuch is the ſubtiltie of the enemie, and the enmity of our nature againſt the Lord, and his waies, that our hearts can find matter of diſcord in this harmonie, and crotchets of diviſion in this holy melodie: for, There have been three queſtions eſpecially ſtirring concerning ſinging. Firſt, what Pſalms are to be ſung in Churches? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Davids</hi> and other Scripture Pſalms, or the Pſalms invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the gifts of godly men in every age of the Church? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if Scripture Pſalms, whether in their own words, or in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49761:15"/>ſuch meeter as Engliſh poetrie is wont to run in? Thirdly, by whom are they to be ſung? whether by the whole Churches together with their voices? or by one man ſinging alone, and the reſtjoyning in ſilence, and in the cloſe ſaying, Amen.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, certainly the ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms was an acceptable worſhip of God, not onely in his own, but in ſucceeding times. As in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13. in <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phats</hi> time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21. in <hi>Ezra</hi> his time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.10, 11. and the text is evident, in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time they are commanded to ſing praiſe in the words of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. which one place may ſerve to reſolve two of the queſtions (the firſt and the laſt) at once, for this commandment was it cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall or morall? ſome things in it indeed were ceremoniall, as their muſical Inſtruments, &amp;c. but what ceremonie was there in ſinging praiſe with the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph?</hi> what if <hi>David</hi> was a type of Chriſt, was <hi>Aſaph</hi> alſo? was every thing of <hi>David</hi> typicall? are his words (which are of morall, univerſall, and perpetuall authoritie in all nations and ages) are they typicall? what type can be imagined in making uſe of his ſongs to praiſe the Lord? If they were typicall becauſe the ceremonie of muſicall Inſtruments was joyned with them, then their prayers were alſo typicall, becauſe they had that ceremony of incenſe admixt with them: but we know that prayer then was a morall dutie, notwithſtanding the incenſe; and ſo ſinging thoſe Pſalms notwithſtanding their muſicall Inſtruments. Beſide, that which was typicall (as that they were ſung with muſicall Inſtruments, by the twenty foure or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prieſts and Levites. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9.) muſt have the morall and ſpirituall accompliſhment in the New Teſtament, in all the Churches of the Saints principally, who are made Kings and Prieſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and are the firſt-fruits unto God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. as the Levites were, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.45. with hearts and lips, inſtead of muſicall Inſtruments, to praiſe the Lord; who are ſet forth (as ſome judiciouſly think) <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.4. by twenty foure Elders, in the ripe age of the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. anſwering to the twenty foure orders of Prieſts and Levites, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſome ſelect members, but the whole Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to teach one another in all the ſeverall ſorts of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, ſome being called by himſelfe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Pſalms, ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Hymnes, ſome <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: ſpirituall ſongs. So
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49761:15"/>that if the ſinging <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms be a morall dutie and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perpetuall; then we under the New Teſtament are bound to ſing them as well as they under the old: and if we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded to ſing Pſalms, Hymnes, and ſpiritual ſongs, then either we muſt ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, or elſe may affirm they are not ſpirituall ſongs: which being penned by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie gift of the Spirit, for the ſake eſpecially of Gods ſpirituall Iſrael; not to be read and preached onely (as other parts of holy Writ) but to be ſung alſo, they are therefore moſt ſpirituall, and ſtill to be ſung of all the Iſrael of God: and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as their ſin is exceeding great, who will allow <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms (as other Scriptures) to be read in Churches (which is one end) but not to be preached alſo (which is another end) ſo their ſin is crying before God, who will allow them to be read and preached, but ſeek to deprive the Lord of the glorie of the third end of them, which is to ſing them in Chriſtian Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. If it be ſaid that the Saints in the primitive Church did compile ſpirituall ſongs of their own inditing, and ſing them before the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We anſwer firſt, that thoſe Saints compiled theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſongs by the extraordinarie gifts of the ſpirit (common in thoſe dayes) whereby they were inabled to praiſe the Lord in ſtrange tongues, wherein learned <hi>Paraeus</hi> proves thoſe Pſalms were uttered, in his Comment on that place, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie gifts, if they were ſtill in the Churches, we ſhould allow them the like libertie now. Secondly, ſuppoſe thoſe Pſalms were ſung by an ordinary gift (which we ſuppoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be evicted) doth it therefore follow that they did not, and that we ought not to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms? muſt the ordinarie gifts of a private man quench the ſpirit ſtill ſpeaking to us by the extraordinarie gifts of his ſervant <hi>David?</hi> there is not the leaſt foot-ſtep of example, or precept, or colour of reaſon for ſuch a bold practiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Miniſters are allowed to pray conceived prayers, and why not to ſing conceived Pſalms? muſt we not ſing in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as well as pray in the ſpirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, becauſe every good Miniſter hath not a gift of ſpirituall poetry to compoſe extemporarie Pſalms as he hath of prayer. Secondly, ſuppoſe he had, yet ſeeing Pſalms are to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49761:16"/>be ſung by a joynt conſent and harmony of all the Church in heart and voice (as we ſhall prove) this cannot be done except he that compoſeth a Pſalm, bringeth into the Church ſet forms of Pſalms of his own invention; for which we find no warrant or preſident in any ordinarie officers of the Church throughout the Scriptures. Thirdly, becauſe the book of Pſalms is ſo compleat a Syſtem of Pſalms, which the holy Ghoſt himſelf in infinite wiſedome hath made to ſute all the conditions, neceſſities, tempations, affections, &amp;c. of men in all ages; (as moſt of all our interpreters on the Pſalrues have fully and particularly cleared) therefore by this the Lord ſeemeth to ſtop all mens mouthes and minds, ordinarily to compile or ſing any other Pſalmes (under colour that the occaſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church are new, &amp;c.) for the publick uſe of the Church; ſeeing, let our condition be what it will, the Lord himſelfe hath ſupplied us with farre better: And therefore in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, though doubtleſſe there were among them, thoſe that had extraordinary gifts to compile new ſongs on thoſe new occaſions, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> &amp;c. yet we read, that they are commanded to ſing in the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> which were ordinarily to be uſed in the publick worſhip of God: And we doubt not but thoſe that are wiſe will eaſily ſee; that thoſe ſet formes of Pſalmes of Gods own appointment, not of mans conceived gift, or humane impoſition, were ſung in the Spirit by thoſe holy Levites, as well as their prayers were in the Spirit which themſelves conceived, the Lord not then binding them therin to any ſet formes; and ſhall ſet formes of Pſalmes appointed of God, not be ſung in the Spirit now, which others did then?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But why may not one compoſe a Pſalme and ſing it alone with a lowd voyce, and the reſt joyne with him in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in the end ſay, <hi>Amen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſuch a practice was found in the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, when any had a Pſalme ſuggeſted by an extraordinary gift, yet in ſinging ordinary Pſalmes, the whole Church is to joyne together in heart and voyce to praiſe the Lord. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes as hath been ſhewed, were ſung in heart and voyce together, by the twenty foure Orders of the Muſicians of the Temple, who typed out the twenty foure El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, all the members eſpecially of Chriſtian Churches, Rev.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49761:16"/>5.8. who are made Kings and Prieſts to God, to praiſe him as they did: for if there were any other order of ſinging Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters beſide the body of the people to ſucceed thoſe, the Lord would doubtleſſe have given direction in the Goſpel for their qualification, election, maintenance, &amp;c. as he did for the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of the Temple, and as his faithfulneſſe hath done for all other Church-officers in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Secondly, others beſide the Levites (the chiefe Singers) in the Jewiſh Church, did alſo ſing the Lords ſongs; elſe why are they commanded frequently to ſing, as in Pſal. 100.1, 2, 3. Pſal. 95.1, 2, 3. Pſal. 102. Title, with v. 18. and Exod. 15.1. not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> but all Iſrael ſang that ſong, they ſpake ſaying (as it is in the <hi>orig.</hi>) all as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> the women alſo as well as the men, ver. 20, 21. and Deut. 32. (whereto ſome think <hi>John</hi> had refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as well as to Exod. 15.1. when he brings in the Proteſtant Churches getting the victory over the beaſt with Harps in their hands, and ſinging the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Rev. 15.3.) this ſong <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is commanded not only to put into their hearts, but into their mouthes alſo, Deut. 31.19. which argues they were with their mouthes to ſing it together as well as with their hearts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretells in the dayes of the new Teſtament, that Gods watchment and deſolate loſt ſouls (ſignified by waſt places) ſhould with their voices ſing together, Iſa. 52.8.9. and Rev. 7.9, 10. the ſong of the Lamb was by many together, and the Apoſte expreſly commands the ſinging of Pſalms, Hymnes, &amp;c. not to any ſelect Chriſtians, but to the whole Church, Eph. 5.19. Col. 3.16. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſang together in private, Acts 16. 25. and muſt the publick heare only one man ſing? To all theſe we may adde the practice of the primitive Churches, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ancient and holy <hi>Baſil,</hi> is in ſtead of many, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. When one of us (ſaith he) hath begun a Pſalme, the reſt of us ſet in to ſing with him, all of us with one heart and one voyce; and this, ſaith he, is the common practice of the Churches of Egypt, Lybia, Thebes, Paleſtina, Syria, and thoſe that dwell on Euphrates, and generally every where, where ſinging of Pſalmes is of any account. To the ſame purpoſe alſo <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives witneſſe, <hi>Eceleſ. hiſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. The objections made againſt this, doe moſt of them plead againſt joyning to ſing in <hi>heart</hi> as well as in <hi>voyce,</hi> as that by this means others out of the Church will ſing, as alſo that we are not alway in a ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49761:17"/>eſtate to the matter ſung, and likewiſe that all cannot ſing with underſtanding; in all not therefore all that have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, joyn in heart and voyce together? Are not all the creatures in heaven, earth, ſeas, men, beaſts, fiſhes, fowles, &amp;c. commanded to praiſe the Lord, and yet none of theſe but men, and godly men too, can doe it with ſpirituall underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>As for the ſcruple that ſome take at the tranſlation of the book of Pſalms into meeter, becauſe <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes were ſung in his own words without meeter: we anſwer. Firſt, there are many verſes together in ſeverall Pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> which run in rithmes (as thoſe that know the Hebrow, and as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ſhewes, <hi>Theſau. p.</hi> 629.) which ſhewes at leaſt the lawfulneſſe of ſinging Pſalmes in Engliſh rithmes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Pſalmes are penned in ſuch verſes as are ſutable to the Poetry of the Hebrew language, and not in the common ſtile of ſuch other books of the old Teſtament, as are not poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; now no Proteſtant doubteth but that all the books of the Scripture ſhould by Gods ordinance be extant in the mother tongue of each nation,<note place="margin">☟ Obſerve Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this Note, viz.</note> that they may be underſtood of all: hence the Pſalms are to betranſlated into our Engliſh tongue: and if in our Engliſh tongue we are to ſing them,<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> on 1 Cor. 11.5. where he proves that it is ſo far from being unlawful for a woman to ſing, becauſe ſhe is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak in the Church, that in ſinging ſhe ought to ſpeak as being her duty of propheſying. I ſay this note being omitted in his place, muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thither viz. 10 pa. 9. lin. the laſt.</note> then as all our Engliſh ſongs (according to the courſe of our Engliſh Poetry) do run in meeter, ſo ought <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms to be tranſlated into meeter, that ſo we may ſing the Lords ſongs, as in our Engliſh tongue, ſo in ſuch verſes as are familiar to an Engliſh care, which are commonly Metrical: and as it can be no juſt offence to any good conſcience to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Hebrew ſongs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh words, ſo neiher to ſing his Poeticall verſes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Poeticall meeter: men might as well ſtumble at ſinging the Hebrew Pſalms in our Engliſh tunes (and not in the Hebrew tunes) as at ſinging them in Engliſh meeter (which are our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) and not in ſuch verſes as are generally uſed by <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Poetry of the Hebrew language: but the truth is, as the Lord hath hid from us the Hebrew tunes, leſt we ſhould think our ſelves bound to imitate them; ſo alſo the courſe and frame (for the moſt part) of their Hebrew Poetry, that we might not think our ſelves bound to imitate that, but that every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without ſcruple might follow as the graver ſort of tunes of their own countrey ſongs, ſo the graver ſort of verſes of their own countrey Poetry.</p>
